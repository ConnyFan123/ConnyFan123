## What I do (PM lens)

I like roles where the work looks like this:

1) **Define the problem clearly** (what decision are we enabling, what metric matters, what’s “good enough”)  
2) **Build the system that keeps working** (repeatable pipeline, reliable dashboard, documented assumptions)  
3) **Make it easy for others to use** (simple narrative, transparent drivers, next actions)

I’m strongest when I’m the person connecting:
- stakeholders who need answers fast,
- data that is messy or inconsistent,
- and a deliverable that is usable in real workflows.

## Experience highlights

### Interpublic Group — Financial Analyst Intern (May 2025 – Dec 2025)
**What I owned**
- Made budget variance analysis understandable to non-technical partners by separating drivers (seasonality, accrual timing, utilization effects) into a consistent narrative.
- Built repeatable tracking workflows (Excel PivotTables / Longview + SAP) across 30+ departmental budgets, validating high-volume transactions and keeping numbers consistent for downstream reporting.
- Designed interactive Power BI dashboards to surface allocation, variance drivers, and historical patterns for cross-functional decision-making.
- Used multi-year history to inform forecasting and annual planning.

**PM-style takeaway:** dashboards aren’t “visuals”—they’re decision products. I treated definitions, refresh cadence, and driver logic as part of the product.

### Roland Berger — Consulting Project Intern (Jan 2024 – Dec 2024)
**What I delivered**
- Competitor benchmarking and market positioning based on large-scale e-commerce and industry data; packaged results into clear strategic options.
- Designed omnichannel marketing strategies for five flagship products, aligning consumer personas, stakeholder feedback, and execution timelines.
- Synthesized interview insights into actionable recommendations (channel mix, distribution, service) and presented marketing cases to support implementation.

**PM-style takeaway:** strategy only matters if it translates into an execution plan people can actually run.

### Zeta Global — Partnership Solutions Intern (Jun 2024 – Aug 2024)
**What I shipped**
- Built campaign report decks with budget reallocation logic across channels, formats, platforms, and timing.
- Used SQL + BI workflows to extract DSP performance data and turn it into audience insights and optimization actions.
- Developed a playbook on client pain points and KPIs, converting analysis into operational guidelines for targeting and measurement.

**PM-style takeaway:** good reporting is “diagnose → decide → do,” not just “summarize.”

## Selected projects (written like mini case studies)

### Elo Merchant Category Recommendation Audit (Kaggle / Independent Research)
**Goal:** stress-test a high-performing model and understand *where* it fails, not just overall score.  
**What I did**
- Rebuilt a LightGBM pipeline on transaction data and designed feature engineering (recency, temporal aggregation, diversity, differentials).
- Used cross-validation and interpretability (SHAP / LIME) to connect drivers to behavior.
- Ran fairness diagnostics by user segments (spending tiers, recency, authorization status) and identified uneven error patterns.
**Output:** a “deployment-ready” audit checklist: drift checks, robustness tests, and transparency ideas (e.g., SHAP-based monitoring dashboards).

### AWS-Based Intelligent Transportation Data Platform (NYU Lab)
**Goal:** a scalable pipeline that supports both real-time ingestion and batch analytics for downstream modeling.  
**What I built**
- Event ingestion via SQS, streaming processing services on EC2, relational integration (MySQL), and structured storage (S3).
- Spark feature pipelines on EMR for large-scale transforms.
- End-to-end orchestration using Step Functions + IAM access control for reliability and security.
**Output:** a workflow that’s automatable, auditable, and ready for iterative modeling.

## Toolbox

**Languages**
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, LightGBM, XGBoost, statsmodels), SQL, R, Java, Scala

**Analytics & BI**
- Power BI, Tableau, Excel (PivotTables), dashboard design, KPI definition, variance decomposition

**Cloud & Data Engineering**
- AWS (EC2, S3, SQS, EMR, Step Functions, IAM), Spark / PySpark

---

## How I work

- I write down definitions early (metric, granularity, refresh cadence, “what counts”).
- I default to “explainable deliverables”: driver trees, assumptions, and edge cases are part of the work.
- I communicate with artifacts: a one-page narrative + a dashboard beats a long meeting.

---

## What I’m looking for

Roles where I can bridge data + decisions:
- Product / Growth Analytics
- Data Science (applied, decision-focused)
- Strategy & Ops / BizOps
- Product Ops / Technical Program support

If your team cares about clarity, execution, and measurable outcomes, I’d love to connect.
